Usage : roll [EQUATION] [EQUATION] ... [OPTIONS] ...
  -h, --help                     display this help and exit
      --version                  output version information and exit
  -v, --verbose                  output more detailed information about the
                                 dice being rolled or coins being flipped.
  -b, --best [TYPE][NUM]         when rolling dice, only add the top/bottom
                                 NUM dice. TYPE can be t for top or highest
                                 or b for bottom or lowest. TYPE defaults
                                 to highest, and NUM defaults to 1.
  -t, --target [INEQUALITY][NUM] compares the equation result to NUM using
                                 INEQUALITY and outputs whether the result
                                 fits the inequality by outputting
                                 "success" or whether it doesn't by
                                 outputting "failure". Be sure to put
                                 single quotes around '[INEQUALITY][NUM]'.
                                 INEQUALITY defaults to '='.
  -m, --multiple [NUM]           repeat the given equations NUM times.

  COINS
  If the first item after roll is "coin", i.e. "roll coin" then a coin
  will be flipped and the result, heads or tails, will be displayed. A
  number of coins can be flipped by putting an integer after "coin", i.e.
  "roll coin 3" will flip 3 coins and output the number of heads and the
  number of tails.
  Coin flips and die rolls cannot happen simultaneously.

  EQUATIONS
  Any number of equations can be provided. If no equations are provided
  then 1d6 is provided by default.
  
  OPERATIONS AND THEIR ORDER
  Operators are executed in the following order, the highest operations
  having the highest priority. For operators that share priority they are
  executed left to right, with the exception of exponents which are
  executed right to left.
  ()     items in parenthesis have the highest priority
  xdy    roll y sided die x times.
         x defaults to 1
         y defaults to 6
  x^y    put x to the power of y, y must be an integer or will be
         converted to one
  x*y    multiply x by y.....shares priority with division
         multiplication can also take the form (x)(y), x(y), and (x)y
  x/y    divide x by y.......shares priority with multiplication
  x+y    add x to y..........shares priority with subtraction
  x-y    subtract y from x...shares priority with addition
  When using ^ or () there must be single quotes around the equation.
