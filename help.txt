Documentation

  -b, --best[=TYPENUM]       Keep the best NUM rolls in an equation and set the
                             rest to 0. A TYPE, h (highest) or l (lowest), and
                             NUM of rolls to select can be specified, in that
                             order. TYPE is h and NUM is 1 by default
  -g, --graph[=INEQUALITY]   NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED. Graph the probability of
                             every possible result. INEQUALITY is '=' by
                             default meaning the probability a roll is equal to
                             a given result
  -m, --multiple=NUM         Repeat the given equations NUM times
  -t, --target=[INEQUALITY]NUM   Compare the result against NUM using
                             INEQUALITY. INEQUALITY is '=' by default
  -v, --verbose              Produce verbose output
  -?, --help                 Give this help list
      --usage                Give a short usage message
  -V, --version              Print program version

Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional
for any corresponding short options.

Additional information
OPERATIONS AND THEIR ORDER
Operators are executed in the following order, the highest operations
having the highest priority. For operators that share priority they are
executed left to right, with the exception of exponents, coin flipping, and
factorial which are executed right to left.
()     items in parenthesis have the highest priority
xdy    roll y sided die x times.
       Shares precedence with coin flipping
xc     flip a coin x times. If x is omited then flip the coin once.
       Shares precedence with die rolling
x^y    put x to the power of y, y must be an integer or will be
       converted to one. Shares priority with factorial
x!     factorial x. Shares precedence with exponent
x*y    multiply x by y. Shares precedence with division
x/y    divide x by y. Shares precedence with multiplication
x+y    add x to y. Shares precedence with subtraction
x-y    subtract y from x. Shares precedence with addition
When using ^, !, * or () there must be quotes around the equation.
